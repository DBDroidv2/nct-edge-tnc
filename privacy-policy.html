                    <p>Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through NCT Enterprises. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as sellers on the marketplace registered on Nctenterprises.in.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service.

Also, in the unlikely event that NCT Enterprises or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </p>

                    <p>
                        We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, processing, and disclosure of personal customer information.

            </p>

            <p>
                Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Nctenterprises ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the
