<h2>Returns and Refunds</h2>
<p>
    Most items purchased from sellers listed on NCT Enterprises are returnable within the return window, except those that are explicitly identified as not returnable. The return is processed only if:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>it is determined that the product was not damaged while in your possession;</li>
    <li>the product is not different from what was shipped to you;</li>
    <li>the product is returned in original condition (with brand's/manufacturer's box, MRP tag intact, user manual, warranty card, and accessories).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If your order is determined to be eligible for a return, we will issue a refund to the original payment method (in case of pre-paid transactions) or to the bank account/as Carrier Coin balance (in case of Pay on Delivery orders). The timeline for making such refund and the process for initiating it will be communicated to you by an email from our customer support team.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the return window for products listed on NCT Enterprises is typically 30 days from the dispatch date. The return window may be shorter for certain products or on occasion. Please check the product page for the specific return policy of the product you are interested in. If you have any questions or concerns regarding returns and refunds, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:customercare@nctenterprises.in">customercare@nctenterprises.in</a>.
