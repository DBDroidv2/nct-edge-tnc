        <h1>Returns and Refunds Policy</h1>
        <p>
            At NCT Enterprises, we want to make sure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, we offer a 7-day return and refund policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is a breakdown of our returns and refunds policy:
        </p>
        <h2>Eligibility for Returns</h2>
        <p>
            Most items purchased from sellers listed on NCT Enterprises are non-returnable, except those that are explicitly identified as returnable. The return is processed only if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The product was not damaged while in your possession;</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The product is not different from what was shipped to you;</li>
            <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> The product is returned in original condition (with brand's/manufacturer's box, MRP tag intact, user manual, warranty card, and accessories).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Products marked as "non-returnable" on the product detail page cannot be returned. However, in an unlikely event of damaged, defective or wrong item delivered to you, we will provide a full refund or replacement, as applicable. We may contact you to ascertain the damage or defect in the product prior to issuing refund/replacement. We reserve the right to pick up the product to ascertain the damage or defect in the product prior to issuing refund/replacement.
        </p>
        <h2>Procedure for Returns</h2>
        <p>
            To initiate a return, you can contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:customercare@nctenterprises.in">customercare@nctenterprises.in</a> and provide us with the following information:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Order ID or Reference ID;</li>
            <li>Reason for return or replacement;</li>
            <li>Photo of the product (if applicable);</li>
            <li>Additional information about the product (if applicable).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Please note that the return window for products listed on NCT Enterprises is typically 7 days from the dispatch date. The return window may be shorter for certain products or on occasion. Please check the product page for the specific return policy of the product you are interested in.
        </p>
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
            If your order is determined to be eligible for a return, we will issue a refund to the original payment method (in case of pre-paid transactions) or to the bank account/as Edge Coin wallet balance (in case of Pay on Delivery orders). The timeline for making such refund and the process for initiating it will be communicated to you by an email from our customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the refund is processed, you will receive an email from our customer support team with the details of the refund process. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the refund process, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:customercare@nctenterprises.in">customercare@nctenterprises.in</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>
            No additional information is required to return an eligible order unless otherwise noted in the category specific policy.
