<h3>Conditions Relating to the Sale of Products to You</h3>
<p>This section deals with conditions relating to the sale of products on the website by us to you.</p>

<h4>Our Contract</h4>
<p>Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgment that we have received your order and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you when the product is dispatched to you and an e-mail confirmation is sent to you that the product has been dispatched to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.</p>
<p>Your contract is with us (the Sellers), and you confirm that the product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your internal/personal purpose and not for resale or business purposes. You authorize us to declare and provide a declaration to any governmental authority on your behalf stating the aforesaid purpose of the products ordered by you on the website.</p>
<p>You can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.</p>
<p>Please note that we sell products only in quantities that correspond to the typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.</p>

<h2><i class="fas fa-coins icon"></i> Terms of Use of Edge coins</h2>
<p>A guide to understanding and using Edge coins on the NCT platform.</p>

<h3>What are Edge coins?</h3>
<p>Edge coins are a specially generated token that are awarded to users for making purchases on the NCT platform. Edge coins can be used to redeem discounts, rewards, and other benefits on the platform. Edge coins are not a cryptocurrency and do not have any monetary value outside the platform.</p>

<h3>How to earn Edge coins?</h3>
<p>Users can earn Edge coins by shopping on the NCT platform and paying with any of the supported payment methods. Users will receive 10% of the order invoice value as Edge coins in their NCT wallet. For example, if a user spends INR 1000 on the platform, they will receive 100 Edge coins in their wallet. The Edge coins will be credited to the user's wallet within 24 hours of the order confirmation.</p>

<h3>How to use Edge coins?</h3>
<p>Users can use Edge coins to redeem discounts, rewards, and other benefits on the NCT platform. Users can view the available offers and benefits on the Edge coins page on the platform. Users can also check their Edge coins balance and transaction history on their NCT wallet page. To use Edge coins, users need to select the Edge coins option at the checkout page. The equivalent amount of the order value will be deducted from the user's Edge coins balance. For example, if a user has 200 Edge coins in their wallet and wants to buy a product worth INR 500, they can use 100 Edge coins to get an INR 100 discount and pay the remaining INR 400 with any of the supported payment methods.</p>

  <li>Edge coins are valid for one year from the date of issuance. Any unused Edge coins will expire after one year and will be removed from the user's wallet.</li>
